In the Annual Budget Document, the Budget Office presents information about the annual cost of various city services/fees for the typical ratepayer. These services and fees include Austin Energy, Austin Water, Austin Resource Recovery, the Clean Community Fee, the Transportation User Fee, the Drainage Utility Fee, and the Property Tax Bill.
This dataset supports the SD23 measure, "Dollar amount and percentage increase of major rates and fees for a range of customer types" (EOA.C.5.c). It contains the approved and amended rates for the typical ratepayer, the annual dollar change, and the annual percent change for each service/fee. This dataset can be used to help understand the cost of city services over time.

Problem Statement
"Analyze the trends in service rates across fiscal years, predict future rate increases for major city services, and build an interactive dashboard to visualize service cost evolution and forecasts."
